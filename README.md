YX : GameMaker : Touch Controls
===============================

> Hi! These are some touch control widgets I made while I was porting my previous LD entry, **[Rainwater (is Free)](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&uid=50909)** for Android.

You'll need to have **GameMaker: Studio** (v1.4x) to run this project, but I believe it will run on **GMS2** just fine.

There are only two objects in this project and, to check their status, all you have to do is watch for updates on them. You can have two analog buttons on screen just fine too! :smile:

## Dependencies

As I said above, you'll need **GameMaker: Studio** to run this project, but version 2 might go nicely too.

## How to Use

Place any of the objects in the room and cook your own way to watch for their properties, then you're good to go! :+1:
